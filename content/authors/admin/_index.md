Hi I am Pratham Sahu, a third year undergradaute student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur(https://cse.iitk.ac.in/). I am interested in Machine learning and its applications in the real world. Theoretical Computer Science and Sytem Development also excite me.
I am also associated with the Programming Club(https://pclub.in/contact/) at IIT Kanpur where I am currently the coordinator. We are a group of like minded individuals who love exploring the multiple domains of Programming. 
I love to travel and hope to someday cross out all the points from my bucket list.
