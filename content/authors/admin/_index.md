Hi I am Pratham Sahu, a third year undergradaute student majoring in [Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://cse.iitk.ac.in/). I am interested in low level computer systems. Lately, I have been
delving into Parallel Computing and Kernel Programming. I have worked a bit on Machine learning in the past.

In addition, I am also associated with the [Programming Club](https://pclub.in/contact/) at IIT Kanpur where I am currently the coordinator. We are a group of like minded individuals who love exploring the multiple domains of Programming. 
Outside the technical realm, I have a penchant for travel. My dream is to one day check off every destination on my travel wish list.
